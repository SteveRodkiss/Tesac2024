# Python and SQL Tutorial for Teachers

## Exemplars and resources
There is a few exemplars at N/A/M/E for the a year 11 group from last year. I only have one complete for this year which is an E. I've also thrown in a cool year 13 project for you take a look at.  
All the Tasks are included. There is also a set of assessment Checklist and Step Ups for Level 1->2->3.  
  
The main Tutorial is in the Tutorial Folder. 
The Database we'll be playing with is here:  https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/chinook.zip
